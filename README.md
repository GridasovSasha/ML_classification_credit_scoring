In this project I implemented binary classification using decision tree methods - sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier, ensemble random forest method - sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier, and also used gradient boosting using XGBoost.

I took the data for the project implementation from GitHub - https://github.com/gastonstat/CreditScoring/blob/master/CreditScoring.csv

Remark: comments in the code will be written in Russian

## Result
As a result, using the trained XGBoost model, I managed to achieve a roc_auc_score value of 0.85
